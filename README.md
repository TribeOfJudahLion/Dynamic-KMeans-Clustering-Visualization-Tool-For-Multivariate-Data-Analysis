## About The Project

**Problem Scenario:**
Acme Corporation is in the process of optimizing their customer segmentation to improve targeted marketing strategies. The marketing team has a vast database of customer information, but it's not clear how to divide the customer base into distinct groups for personalized marketing campaigns. The data includes various customer behaviors and characteristics such as age, spending score, income, and shopping frequency.

**Solution Using the Provided Code:**
The provided code can be used to address Acme Corporation's problem by applying the KMeans clustering algorithm to their customer data. The solution will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   Acme Corporation will need to prepare their customer data in a format suitable for analysis. The data will be saved in a text file, where each line represents a customer, and each customer's behaviors and characteristics are comma-separated values (CSV format).

2. **Load Data:**
   Using the `load_data` function, the prepared data file, `data_multivar.txt`, will be loaded into a NumPy array. This array will facilitate numerical operations that are required for the KMeans algorithm.

3. **Initial Data Visualization:**
   Before clustering, it's insightful to visualize the data using the `plot_initial_data` function. This will allow the team to get a sense of the data distribution and to hypothesize about potential customer segments.

4. **KMeans Clustering:**
   The `train_kmeans` function will apply the KMeans algorithm to the data to identify clusters. The number of clusters, `num_clusters`, is set to 4, hypothesizing that there are four distinct types of customers in the dataset. This parameter can be adjusted based on further analysis or business intuition.

5. **Results Visualization:**
   After training the model, the `plot_kmeans_results` function will visualize the clusters by plotting the data points and coloring them according to their assigned cluster. It will also plot the centroids of each cluster, which represent the 'average' customer in that segment.

6. **Business Insights and Actions:**
   - **Segmentation**: Acme Corporation will now have their customers divided into four distinct segments, which can be analyzed to understand the defining characteristics of each group.
   - **Targeted Marketing**: With these segments, the marketing team can design targeted strategies that cater to the specific needs and behaviors of each group.
   - **Resource Allocation**: Marketing resources can be allocated more efficiently, focusing on the most profitable segments or on those with the highest growth potential.
   - **Personalization**: Product recommendations, email marketing, and promotions can be personalized based on the segments, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

7. **Iterative Optimization:**
   The marketing team will monitor the performance of the segmented marketing campaigns and gather new customer data. They can rerun the clustering process with updated data and potentially refine the number of clusters to adapt to changes in customer behavior over time.

By using the provided code, Acme Corporation can transform their broad customer data into actionable segments, driving more effective marketing strategies and potentially increasing ROI on their marketing spend.

This Python script demonstrates the use of the KMeans clustering algorithm from the scikit-learn library to cluster a set of data points.

1. **Import Libraries**
   - `numpy`: A library for numerical computations in Python.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot`: A plotting library used for creating visualizations in Python.
   - `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster`: The KMeans clustering algorithm from scikit-learn.

2. **Function Definitions**
   - `load_data(file_path)`: This function loads data from a specified file path using NumPy's `loadtxt` method. It handles exceptions that might occur during file loading (e.g., file not found, read errors).
   - `plot_initial_data(data)`: This function plots the initial data points as scatter plots. It uses `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization and calls `set_plot_limits` to adjust the axes limits.
   - `set_plot_limits(data)`: Sets the limits for the plot based on the range of data, ensuring all points are comfortably within the view.
   - `train_kmeans(data, num_clusters)`: Trains a KMeans model on the provided data. It initializes the KMeans algorithm with 'k-means++' for centroids initialization, `num_clusters` as the number of clusters, and `n_init=10` indicating the number of time the k-means algorithm will run with different centroid seeds.
   - `plot_kmeans_results(data, kmeans, step_size=0.01)`: This function visualizes the results of the KMeans clustering. It creates a mesh grid covering the data range and predicts cluster labels for every point in the grid, creating a colored plot indicating different clusters. It also plots the original data points and the centroids of the clusters, annotating the centroids with their respective cluster numbers.

3. **Main Script**
   - The `main` function orchestrates the execution flow:
     - It defines the input file name and the number of clusters.
     - It calls `load_data` to load the data and checks if data loading was successful.
     - If successful, it plots the initial data, trains a KMeans model, and then plots the results using the trained model.

4. **Execution Trigger**
   - The script is executed if it's run as the main program (not imported as a module in another script).

5. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - The script not only performs the clustering but also visualizes the data points, the resultant clusters, and their centroids. This is crucial for analyzing how well the KMeans algorithm has performed in clustering the data.

This script is an excellent example of implementing and visualizing KMeans clustering. It is structured to be modular, with separate functions for loading data, plotting, and performing the clustering, making it easy to understand and modify.

The before and after of applying the KMeans clustering algorithm to a dataset:

1. **Input Data Visualization**
   The first image depicts the initial state of the data before clustering. The data points are plotted in a two-dimensional space, scattered without any visible partitioning or grouping. This is typically the first step in cluster analysis, where you examine the raw data to understand its structure and distribution. The points are shown as open circles, and there seems to be no clear separation between different groups or clusters at this stage.

2. **KMeans Clustering Results**
   The second image shows the results after the KMeans clustering algorithm has been applied to the same dataset. Here's the detailed breakdown:
   - **Clusters**: The data points have been divided into four distinct clusters, each represented by a different color in the background. This color division is the result of the KMeans algorithm assigning each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.
   - **Centroids**: Each cluster has a centroid, marked with a white-filled circle and a black border. The centroids are the average of all points in the cluster and serve as the 'center' of the cluster.
   - **Cluster Labels**: Near each centroid, there's an annotation indicating the cluster number (e.g., "Cluster 1", "Cluster 2", etc.). This labeling helps in identifying and referring to each cluster.
   - **Boundaries**: The change in background color marks the boundaries of each cluster. These boundaries are determined by the points in the space that are equidistant to the nearest centroids. The algorithm assigns all the points within a boundary to the corresponding centroid.
   
The clustering result shows how KMeans has organized the data into groups based on the proximity of data points to each cluster's centroid. These groupings can reveal patterns and structures within the dataset that may not be obvious in the raw data. The clear demarcation of boundaries and the central location of centroids demonstrate a successful clustering process, providing a visual and analytical way to understand the data's segmentation.

The initial data plot serves as a starting point, and the KMeans results showcase the outcome of the clustering algorithm. The visualization of the centroids and boundaries is crucial for interpreting the clustering performance and for making further decisions based on the clustered data.

## Built With

This project leverages several powerful tools and libraries to perform unsupervised learning with KMeans clustering algorithm and to visualize data clusters.

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. Our project uses NumPy for efficient data storage and manipulation, enabling the loading and processing of datasets as arrays.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. We use Matplotlib's pyplot to create figures and plots, allowing us to visualize data points and the results of the KMeans clustering.

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including KMeans, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Our code uses the KMeans clustering algorithm from scikit-learn to identify and learn patterns from our dataset.

Each of these libraries is open source and widely used in both academic and commercial settings. Together, they form a robust platform for machine learning tasks ranging from data preprocessing to algorithm implementation and visualization.
